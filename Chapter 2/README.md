# Notes

## Goals
* robustness
> produce the right output for all the anticipated inputs in the program application.
* adaptability / evolvability
> be able to evolve over time in reponse to changing conditions in its environment.
* reusability
> same code should be useable as a component of different systems in various applicatons.

## Design Principles
* Modularity
> an organizing principle in which different components of a software system are
divided into separate functional units.
* Abstraction
> distill a complicated system down to its most fundamental parts.
* Encapsulation
Different components of a software system should not reveal the internal details
of their respective implementations
